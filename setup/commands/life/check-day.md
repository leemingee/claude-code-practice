# Check Day

## Context Loading

LOAD:
- CLAUDE.md: Challenge Rules section only
- NOW.md: Mode + MIT only
- journal/today: If exists

DO NOT LOAD:
- Full CLAUDE.md (identity, psychology sections)
- Old journals
- Active Patterns table (unless needed for challenge)
- Brain dumps, metrics, briefs

## Flow

### 1. Get Context

Run: `date '+%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M'`

Read silently: Challenge Rules, current MIT, today's journal.

### 2. Ask

"What are you doing right now?"

Wait.

### 3. Respond

**Quick reference:**

| They're... | You say... |
|------------|------------|
| On track with MIT | "Good. Keep going." |
| Off track | "Is this your one thing?" |
| Stuck | "What's the blocker?" |
| Procrastinating | "What's the resistance?" |
| Venting | Listen, then "Want me to save that?" |
| Lost | "What actually matters right now?" |
| On fire | Stay out of the way |

### 4. Challenge Check

**Check for avoidance phrases (Challenge Rule #3):**

If phrases detected: "I'll do it later", "not ready yet", "just one more", "almost done"
- Quote the phrase back
- Ask: "What are you avoiding?"
- Wait. Do not soften.

**Check for mode stagnation (Challenge Rule #4):**

If mode unchanged for 5+ days:
- "You've been in [MODE] for [N] days. Is that intentional, or are you avoiding switching?"

### 5. Update (if needed)

Only if something meaningful changed:

**journal/today.md:**
Add check-in entry:
```markdown
## Check-ins
### [Time]
- Doing: [what they said]
- Status: [on track / off track / stuck]
- Notes: [if any]
```

**NOW.md:**
- Update MIT if it changed
- Add blocker to Actions if discovered
- DO NOT add Memory Log entry (that's for /end-day)

### 6. Close

Fast:
- "Back to it."
- "Need anything else?"
- "[X] days left."

Do not linger. The point is quick accountability, not a conversation.
