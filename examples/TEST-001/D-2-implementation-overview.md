# Implementation Overview: D-2

## Summary
Created comprehensive documentation explaining how to use the workflow system example.

## Files Created
- `examples/README.md`: Full documentation with:
  - How to run the example
  - Explanation of each workflow checkpoint
  - Key files reference
  - Commands used in the workflow

## Key Decisions
- Documented the full workflow process as experienced during TEST-001
- Included command examples for each workflow phase
- Added table of key files for easy reference

## Documentation Sections
1. Running the example (with expected output)
2. How the workflow was demonstrated
3. Key files reference table
4. Workflow commands used
5. Guide for creating new workflow tasks

## Notes
This completes the TEST-001 workflow. The example successfully demonstrates:
- State persistence across subtasks
- Checkpoint progression
- Implementation overview generation
- To-do tracking
